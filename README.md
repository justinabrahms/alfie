Alfie
=====

Alfie is a chrome extension which will help you find what you're looking for in
a myriad of tabs. You open Alfie, type in a word that's in the title or the url
of the tab you want such as "inbox" and Alfie will show you the tabs that
match. You can then press Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+0 (for 10) and choose the tab
that matches and you'll be whisked away to the tab you want.
